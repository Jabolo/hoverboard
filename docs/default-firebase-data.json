During this time, I collected useful tips and tricks to make the proccess easier and more fun.   During the workshop, I will present a sample system design intreview question and walk through a solution which can easily impress interviewers.

Unfortunately, sometimes we forget some people cannot use it the same way as most of us - e.g. people with vision, motion, or cognitive disabilities. Why is accessibility so unpopular among developers? I believe it's not because of bad will - we often don't understand our users' problems. It's why I want to show some tricks to better understand users with disabilities, talk about the most popular mistakes (and fixes for them), and improvements you can include in your development process to avoid accessibility problems in the future.",
